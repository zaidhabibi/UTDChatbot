Freshman Admissions: Criteria

Applicants who have completed coursework at a college or university after high school graduation (excluding the summer) should apply for transfer admission.

Admission Review Criteria
Every student brings something unique to our community that encompasses achievements, experiences and viewpoints. All applicants are reviewed individually and holistically. Consideration is given to the following factors:
Overall grades in academic coursework and trends in achievement.Strength of high school curriculum, including level of rigor (AP, IB, dual credit).High school rank and GPA.SAT I or ACT test scores, if available.Preparation for and ability to be successful in intended major.Information provided in optional supplemental materials. We encourage all applicants to submit supplemental materials, including:A resume.An application essay response from either ApplyTexas or CommonApp.Letter(s) of recommendation (limited to a maximum of three).
Texas Top 10%
As Texas law requires, students will be automatically admitted to UT Dallas as first-time freshmen if they graduate in the top 10% of their class from an accredited Texas high school and successfully earn the Distinguished Level of Achievement. Applicants must have graduated from high school during one of the two school years preceding the academic year for which they seek admission as first-time freshmen and have not attempted any college-level coursework since graduation from high school.
Applicants admitted because they are in the top 10% of their high school class may be required to complete additional preparatory work before enrolling in the University or complete developmental coursework to remove any deficiencies in their readiness to complete college-level work before University graduation.
Home-Schooled and GED
As required by Texas Senate Bill 1543, applicants who present evidence of obtaining a non-traditional secondary education (for example, those who were home-schooled or earned a GED instead of a high school diploma) will be assigned a percentile rank compared to the average class rank of students from traditional schools who have equivalent SAT or ACT test scores.
Major-Specific Requirements
Students who are not admitted into their first choice of major due to capacity constraints or major-specific requirements may be offered admission to a different major as outlined in their acceptance letter.
International Applicants
International applicants must meet the criteria for freshman admission and additional steps, such as satisfying the English proficiency requirement. Be sure to review the international applicant’s webpage for a list of additional required materials for a complete application.

Recommendations & Announcements
Transportation to International Student Orientation (ISO)
Comet Cruiser 883 buses (neighborhood bus service) start running at 7 a.m. every 9 minutes Monday through Thursday and every 12 minutes on Fridays. The 883 East and 883 East Express buses start running at 7 a.m. every 30 minutes. View the Comet Cruiser schedule online. Please, plan strategically an EARLY arrival to the International Student Orientation (ISO). ISO check-in starts 90 minutes and ends 30 minutes before the beginning of each ISO.
Students should board EARLY. The best way to minimize overloading is to arrive early. ICP does not recommend waiting for the last bus before the event since that will most likely be full and you will be late. Late arrival to ISO may prevent you from participation.
No pass, ID, payment, or fare is required for Comet Cruiser (883 buses).
Be sure to stand at the bus stop. The buses cannot stop anywhere except at the bus stop. Once the bus leaves the bus stop, it cannot stop again so you need to be at their stop early, and ready to board.
Avoid jaywalking to bus stops. Only cross roadways at pedestrian crosswalks to access bus stops (especially important for those living at 7421 at Frankford, and the Frankford Estates!).
The bus times listed on the website are DEPARTURE times, not arrival times. Students should be at their stop ~5 minutes early to avoid missing their bus.
No open food or drinks are allowed on the Comet Cruiser.
Location of the Orientation
ISO will take place in the Student Union Galaxy A, B, and C and Edith O’Donnell Arts & Technology Building (ATC) Lecture Hall. Please check the location of the ISO based on the confirmation email you received after registration. The campus map is available here.

If the date you would like to attend International Student Orientation is not showing in Orion, then that date is already at full capacity for attendance. Please choose an alternative date to attend. Additionally, you can continue to check back as dates may become available as other students may change their orientation. See the International Student Orientation Registration Instructions.
What happens if I do not complete the International Student Orientation?
If you do not complete the Pre-Arrival Modules and International Student Orientation, a hold will be assigned to your UTD account, effective the first day of classes, restricting you to register in the following academic term.
Are the Tuberculosis Test (TB test) and Meningitis Vaccination required?
The TB test is mandatory for all students born outside of the United States. Students will take their TB test when they arrive in the U.S.
Spring 2023 International Students: Students will receive a detailed message a day after registering for International Student Orientation, including a link to select date and time to schedule their TB test appointment.
Spring 2023 Freshman and Transfer International Students: Students should schedule their TB test using this link after December 1.
To learn more about the TB requirement, visit the Student Health Center immunizations webpage. Contact the Student Health Center for any questions regarding the TB test requirement.
All students that are under the age of 22 are required to receive the meningitis vaccination. For questions regarding this requirement, please contact the Office of the Registrar.
Do I need health insurance?
Health insurance is required for all F-1, F-2, J-1, and J-2 international students. You can find more information on the Student Health Insurance webpage. Students may be eligible for a health insurance waiver if they satisfy the Student Health Insurance’s requirements. For more information, consult the Student Health Insurance webpage, section of waivers.
What is a hold and how can I remove it?
Holds on your student account prevent you from registering for classes. To view all holds on your account, use your Net-ID and Password to login to Galaxy. In your “Orion Student Center” you can click on “Holds” and view all existing holds on your account. If you click on each individual hold, you can get more information about which department has put the hold on your account and why. The department that puts your hold on is the only department that can take the hold off.
When do I have to pay for tuition?
You will receive a tuition and fee bill after registering for classes. For more information regarding tuition and fees please visit the Bursar Office webpage. For information about payment deadlines view the Academic Calendar for Spring.
What are UTD policies concerning face masks, international travel, and COVID-19 vaccinations?
Face masks: UTD encourages members of the University community to wear face masks and follow the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for the use of masks. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s Executive Order GA-36 prohibits governmental entities from requiring or mandating mask wearing. We highly recommend wearing a face mask for International Student Orientation.
International travel: Please note that effective June 12, 2022, all nonimmigrant, non-citizen air travelers to the United States will not be required a negative COVID-19 test result prior to boarding an airplane to the U.S. All nonimmigrant, non-citizen air travelers to the United States will continue being required to be fully vaccinated and provide proof of vaccination status against COVID-19 prior to boarding an airplane to the U.S. For more information, please consult the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Vaccination: The COVID-19 vaccination is not mandatory at UTD. However, UTD faculty, staff and students are highly encouraged to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible. Students can book an appointment through a vaccine provider. UTD asks fully-vaccinated faculty, staff and students to register their vaccination status through the UT Dallas voluntary vaccine reporting tool.
I am concerned about travel restrictions due to COVID-19, can I enroll in courses online?
For questions regarding enrollment options in the event of travel restrictions, please contact your graduate or undergraduate program advisor. To find your program advisor please visit the Academic Programs website: utdallas.edu/academics. Click on your major and degree level. This will take you to an information page about your degree program, and will include department contact information.
Where can I obtain resources such as pre arrival and post arrival check lists, housing, travel guides, webinars, and the new student guide?
New international students are encouraged to consult the Intercultural Programs (ICP) webpage, section of pre-arrival resources.

Vaccination Requirement – Bacterial Meningitis
Vaccination Requirement
Per Texas Senate Bill no. 62, beginning January 1, 2012, all entering Texas college students, under the age of 22, must receive a vaccination or booster (if the vaccination is five years old) against bacterial meningitis before enrollment. Acceptable forms of the vaccination include Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MenACWY), Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccines (MCV) or Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (MPSV4). The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) notes the vaccination with the MenB vaccine should not replace the vaccination with MENACWY. Therefore, it does not constitute as a replacement for the meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) and does not fulfill the vaccination requirement.
Before you will be allowed to register in classes you must submit:
A completed Meningococcal Meningitis Vaccine Requirement Form (PDF)
Proof of immunization or the Affidavit for Exemption from Immunizations for Reasons of Conscience. Initiate your request to TDSHS well before your intended orientation date. It may take several weeks to receive your form during peak times. Only original copies of Affidavits are accepted.
Original Affidavits should only be mailed to the University. Online submissions are not permissible. Please mail to the following address:
The University of Texas at Dallas The Office of the Registrar, SSB13 800 West Campbell Rd Richardson, TX 75080-3021
Evidence of vaccination must verify that the vaccination was received during the five year period prior to and no later than 10 days before the first day of the term, per the academic calendar. Failure to receive vaccination by the dates below will prevent you from attending classes for the term.
If you are returning to campus or considered a new, incoming or transfer student, please see the following:
Fall 2023 Term - Meningitis vaccine must be taken between August 21, 2018 and August 11, 2023.
Summer 2023 Term - Meningitis vaccine must be taken between May 24, 2018 and May 14, 2023.
Spring 2023 Term - Meningitis vaccine must be taken between January 17, 2018 and January 7, 2023.
What is acceptable evidence of vaccination?
Documentation must be in English, state the name and other information sufficient to identify the individual who received the required vaccination, state the month, date and year the vaccine was administered.
A statement provided by physician or other health care provider authorized by law to administer the vaccine. The statement must include the name, address, signature or stamp, state of licensure and license number of the physician or other healthcare provider who administered the required vaccination; or of the public health official who administered the vaccination.
An official immunization record generated from the state or local health authority
An official record received directly from a Texas school official, or a school official in another state.
