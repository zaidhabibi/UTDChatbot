Vaccination Requirement – Bacterial Meningitis
Vaccination Requirement
Per Texas Senate Bill no. 62, beginning January 1, 2012, all entering Texas college students, under the age of 22, must receive a vaccination or booster (if the vaccination is five years old) against bacterial meningitis before enrollment. Acceptable forms of the vaccination include Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MenACWY), Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccines (MCV) or Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (MPSV4). The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) notes the vaccination with the MenB vaccine should not replace the vaccination with MENACWY. Therefore, it does not constitute as a replacement for the meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) and does not fulfill the vaccination requirement.
Before you will be allowed to register in classes you must submit:
A completed Meningococcal Meningitis Vaccine Requirement Form (PDF)
Proof of immunization or the Affidavit for Exemption from Immunizations for Reasons of Conscience. Initiate your request to TDSHS well before your intended orientation date. It may take several weeks to receive your form during peak times. Only original copies of Affidavits are accepted.
Original Affidavits should only be mailed to the University. Online submissions are not permissible. Please mail to the following address:
The University of Texas at Dallas The Office of the Registrar, SSB13 800 West Campbell Rd Richardson, TX 75080-3021
Evidence of vaccination must verify that the vaccination was received during the five year period prior to and no later than 10 days before the first day of the term, per the academic calendar. Failure to receive vaccination by the dates below will prevent you from attending classes for the term.
If you are returning to campus or considered a new, incoming or transfer student, please see the following:
Fall 2023 Term - Meningitis vaccine must be taken between August 21, 2018 and August 11, 2023.
Summer 2023 Term - Meningitis vaccine must be taken between May 24, 2018 and May 14, 2023.
Spring 2023 Term - Meningitis vaccine must be taken between January 17, 2018 and January 7, 2023.
What is acceptable evidence of vaccination?
Documentation must be in English, state the name and other information sufficient to identify the individual who received the required vaccination, state the month, date and year the vaccine was administered.
A statement provided by physician or other health care provider authorized by law to administer the vaccine. The statement must include the name, address, signature or stamp, state of licensure and license number of the physician or other healthcare provider who administered the required vaccination; or of the public health official who administered the vaccination.
