Transfer Admissions: Criteria
You are considered a transfer student if you have previously completed college-level coursework at an accredited institution — excluding the summer following high school graduation.
Applications are accepted for the fall, spring and summer semesters from students in good standing at their higher education institutions. If you are currently enrolled in high school and also attending a college/university and you will not complete any college-level coursework after the summer after your high school graduation, you should apply for freshman admission.
