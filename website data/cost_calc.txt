Actual costs will vary from student to student. The cost of tuition is based on the number of hours you are enrolled in during the semester, when you began your enrollment at UT Dallas, and costs specific to the program you are pursuing. The cost of living expenses will also vary from student to student. Personal spending patterns, living arrangement choices, and other factors will influence these costs. The COA assigned to you is based on your responses to the housing questions on your FAFSA. If your enrollment plans change, please complete the Financial Aid Hours Adjustment Form and submit it to the Office of Financial Aid, as adjustments may need to be made to your financial aid package.
